This is drum kit , One of my favorite projects I have build so far.
I created this drum kit using HTML , CSS and JavaScript.
This drum consists of 6 boxes with different sound such as snare,kick,tom etc.

Each boxes are used with click or keydown eventListener.
For eg letter Q can cosist of Tom sound whereas letter A can consist of Snare Sound.
Here also different letter consists of different sound .
You can use this drum kit to make your own drum in your laptop.




Do try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Thank you!!
